          Within this introduction, you will be able to grow an appreciation for
          Latin and its descendants by learning about its origins, its literary
          survey through the ages, and its pronunciation system.

          Latin's Linguistic History
        </h4>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          Within English, there are certain words that have retained, more or
          less, their original form that has existed thousands of years ago, and
          have retained this form over many different languages like Greek,
          Latin, Sankrit, Russian, Old Irish, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          Take for example the word brother: in Sankrit, bhrātar, in Greek,
          phrātēr, in Latin, frāter, in Anglo-Saxon, brōthor, in Old Irish,
          brathir, etc. There are many other cognates (comes from the Latin,
          conatus, or born together) that show that they all share a common
          progenitor.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          Although English ultimately derives from Anglo-Saxon, it shares a
          common ancestor with all of the aforementioned languages. This common
          ancestor is known as Indo-European. It is called as such because it
          has roots in both India and Europe. On top of cognates, languages like
          Greek, Sanskrit, Latin, etc, all share common inflections, or word
          endings.
        </p>

          />
        </figure>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          Now to explain the difference between cognate and derived languages.
          On the one hand, one can say that Latin and English are cognate
          languages but they are more like cousins. They share the same
          grandparents but not the same parents. The parent of Latin is Italic
          whereas the parent for English is Anglo-Saxon. On the other hand,
          derived languages are like siblings in that they share the same
          parent. For an example, Romance languages <strong>derive</strong> from
          Latin, thus being siblings.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          As a result of the Roman conquest of Europe, modern Romance langauges
          <strong>derive</strong> from the same parent, that is Latin. Since
          Rome was able to conquer these areas, the plebians from each section
          mixed their own dialect with the Latin of the rulers, thereby creating
          the modern Romance languages overtime.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          Now for the history of English. After the German barbarians conquered
          most of British Isle, a new language was formed called Anglo-Saxon.
          This language had some Latin borrowings but overtime took more and
          more, especially in the 7th ce when the Catholic church sent monks to
          the island to Christianize them. As a result, the Latin of Jerome
          seeped into Anglo-Saxon. Then, in 1066, after the Normans had
          conquered the isle, Norman French became the language of high society
          whereas Anglo-Saxon remained in use by the plebians. However, two
          centuries later, Anglo-Saxon reasserted itself and became used by the
          high class once again, but this time with many borrowings from French.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          Having been infused with French, Anglo-Saxon became Middle English in
          the 13th and 14th ce. Continuing into the Elizabethean Renaissance and
          the 16th/17th ce, English continued to take more from French and Latin
          in order to cultivate itself and bloom into a respected language. Even
          today, scientists and academics continue to take from Latin in order
          to coin new words into English.
        </p>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          Now to finish this section, let's discuss something called Grimm's
          law. This explains how certain consonants changed over the evolution
          of Germanic languages, including English. The Latin hard p became a
          softened f (pēs -> foot), the hard c or k became h (cor -> heart) and
          d became t (dēns -> tooth).

          Archaic through Early Republican Period (down to ~80 BC)
        </h5>
        <h6 class="title is-6">6th and 5th ce BC</h6>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          In contrast to Greek litterae, the Roman's was in poor state during
          the 6th and 5th ce BC. Evidence from this time period shows that the
          state of their literature was unremarkable. Mostly a few poems written
          in the Saturnian meter, some comical skits, and some simple prose for
          speeches and record keeping have been found.
        </p>
        <h6 class="title is-6 pt-5">3rd ce BC</h6>
        <p class="is-size-5-desktop p-1">
          During this time period, Rome expanded and came into contact with the
          Greeks, whom they admired and from whom they learned the art of
          literature. The Greeks taught the Romans their literary forms,
          rhetorical devices, subjects, and ideas which all contributed to the
          progression of Roman literary culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two high examples of this Greek refinement can be found in Plautus
          (254 - 184 BC) and Terence (189 - 159 BC) who both adapted the Greek
          model of Comedy into Latin. Both of their works continued to influence
          European literature 1800 years after their deaths in Molière and
          Shakespeare.
